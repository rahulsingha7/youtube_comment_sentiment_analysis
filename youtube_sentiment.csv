Such an interesting topic!,Positive
"Pretty good explanation, but not perfect in my opinion. You mention the acquisition, cleaning and division of data into training sets and test sets,",Corrective
"which is true for so called supervised learning, but this isn't the case in all types of machine learning. Some problems have no clear data or an easy way to divide data,such as when using reinforcement learning to train agents to play games. In this example, the model learns by performing actions in a simulated game environment.So the data is generated on the fly, and it's not really possible to divide it into different sets.",Corrective
Accuracy is not an error function but a metric. For classification task an error function can be binary Cross entropy,Corrective

If this is a video for people that already have some experience with coding than it is not teaching much. You should explain some stuff in more details why things are one way or another.  If this video is for complete newbies that just want to type along and have something working - you are jumping to fast between similar classes and files and make it confusing. Also one example like at around 30min there was an error in app and you just skipped what I would guess 10-15min and jumped to where it is solved. This course is 11h already, do no skip parts where you solving issues. Because people will have issues and these bits are most helpful.",Corrective
